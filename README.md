# Decentralized Intellectual Property Licensing for Music

A blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how musical works are registered, licensed, tracked, and monetized. This system provides transparent, efficient, and automated management of music rights and royalties across the global digital ecosystem.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) addresses the fragmented and opaque nature of music licensing and royalty distribution by creating a unified, transparent system on the blockchain. Artists, labels, publishers, and platforms can interact directly with verifiable ownership records, automated licensing agreements, and real-time royalty distributions.

## Core Components

### Song Registration Contract

Establishes verifiable ownership and rights records for musical works on the blockchain.

**Features:**
- Immutable proof of authorship and ownership
- Split rights management (composers, performers, producers)
- Metadata storage including ISRC/ISWC codes
- Version control for derivative works and remixes
- Digital fingerprinting integration
- Copyright registration integration
- Publishing and master rights distinction
- Historical rights transfers and documentation

### Licensing Terms Contract

Defines and manages the terms under which music can be used across different platforms and contexts.

**Features:**
- Customizable license templates for different use cases
- Territory-specific licensing conditions
- Platform-specific usage rights (streaming, downloads, sync)
- Time-limited licensing options
- Rate card management for different usage types
- Automated approval for standard licenses
- Manual approval workflow for complex licenses
- Machine-readable license terms for platform integration

### Streaming Tracking Contract

Monitors and verifies music usage across various digital platforms and services.

**Features:**
- Cross-platform play count aggregation
- Stream verification through oracle networks
- API integration with major streaming services
- Fraud detection for artificial plays
- Regional usage tracking and analytics
- User demographic data aggregation (anonymized)
- Performance and broadcast tracking
- Usage reporting dashboard

### Royalty Distribution Contract

Automates the collection and disbursement of payments to all rights holders based on actual usage.

**Features:**
- Smart contract-based payment splitting
- Real-time micropayments option
- Multi-currency support including cryptocurrency and fiat
- Tax withholding automation
- Escrow services for disputed royalties
- Customizable payment thresholds and schedules
- Complete payment history and audit trail
- Direct deposit to artist wallets

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum/Polygon/Solana
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity/Rust
- **Data Storage:** IPFS for music files and metadata
- **Oracle Network:** Chainlink for external data verification
- **Frontend:** React.js with ethers.js integration
- **Audio Fingerprinting:** Integration with acoustic fingerprinting services
- **Identity Management:** Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for artists and rights holders
- **Interoperability:** Support for music industry standards (DDEX, CWR)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
